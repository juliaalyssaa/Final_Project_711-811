# Duckweed Microbiome QIIME2 Project

The goal of this project is to analyze 16S rRNA sequencing data from microbiome samples associated with duckweed. The aim is to compare and identify the differences in microbial communities between duckweed surfaces and surrounding pond water using QIIME2.

## Group Members
- Julia Murray
- Kayla Royce

## Project Overview

Data for bioinformatic pathway analysis through qiime2:
- **40 FASTQ files** (20 paired-end samples)
- **16s rRNA data**
- **Illumina HiSeq 2500**
- **Paired-end, 250 bp reads**

### Methods
- **2 Sampling Locations**
- **2 Treatments:**
  - Duckweed surface microbiome
  - Pond water microbiome
- **5 Replicates per treatment/location**

### Files Provided
- `manifest.tsv`
